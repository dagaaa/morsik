Will she face more dangers, or fight the same battles?\n\nMore than 100 years since women began winning the right to vote, many societies are still dominated by men.\n\nMillions of teenage girls worldwide do not finish school, beginning their childbearing years as their counterparts in the West are beginning to dream of careers and qualifications.\n\nYet the world is a better place for women than ever before. Maternal health is improving, as is access to education. Wages are rising, and women have entered the world's boardrooms.\n\nThroughout October, the BBC's 100 Women season will look at the world we live in today through the eyes of the women who make up half the world."}
