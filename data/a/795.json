More than 500 million adults - or 69% of the adults, up from 51% in 2011 - have a \"bank account\" at a brick-and-mortar bank or a mobile money provider today.\n\nBut women, according to the report, continue to lag behind men: 65% of them have an account compared to 72% of men, a gap of seven percentage points that has remained unchanged since 2011.\n\nThis is despite the shrinking of the gender gap in many countries. In India, for example, 83% of men and 77% of women have a bank account - the gender gap in India has declined to 6 percentage points from 20 in 2014.\n\nSo how are these six disparate countries in Europe, South America and Asia bucking the gender trend? Leora Klapper, lead economist at the World Bank, offers some clues."}
