She was found in a vacant lot on 13 October.\n\nPolice say the killings could be connected based on the proximity of the murders and time frame, but Mr Dugan said he was cautious about using the term serial killer.\n\nThe FBI are helping local police in the investigation and have released a photo of a possible suspect, but a motive is still unclear.\n\nLocal police are accompanying students to bus stops in the wake of the murders, department spokesman Steve Hegarty told the Tampa Bay Times newspaper on Monday.\n\nOfficers first began escorting residents during a vigil held after dark on Sunday.\n\nA crowd of more than 100 marched to the scenes of the murders and chanted: \"Whose streets? Our streets.\"\n\nThe US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Crime Stoppers of Tampa Bay have offered a $25,000 reward (Â£19,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the murders."}
