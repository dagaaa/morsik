So the money was always there,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking to Conservative MP Anna Soubry on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, the reality star said: \"We never got an answer [to], 'why did you feel that they should be paid more than us, for us all to come and do the exact same thing on the same day, the same outcome?'.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old said her boyfriend told her that when he worked with other men they were paid the same, irrespective of how well-known they were.\n\n\"They would never dream of insulting four men that way, but they'll tell the two girls and make up some ridiculous reason, but it was really because they thought they'd get away with it.\n\n\"That was really an eye-opener and it's made me angry,\" she said.\n\nMs Attwood also said that she had previously worked as a \"grid girl\" for Formula 1, a role the sport's bosses said would no longer be used from this season.\n\nShe said she knew that fans of the sport did not need to see half-naked girls to enjoy it.\n\n\"But by the same token, if a particular girl wants to do that and she finds that really fun and she gets to travel the world doing it, I think you can go so far and take the fun out of everything, can't you?\"\n\nShe added that the models were always very well looked after by the Formula 1 teams, and \"no-one got within 5m [15ft] of us\" and that they were told to shout about it \"if anyone had crossed any boundaries\".\n\nMs Attwood added: \"So my experience with it was really good and really positive, whereas other girls might not have had the same protection.\"\n\nWatch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel."}
