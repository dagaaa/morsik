That is what England have left us with today. After giving us hope of a better future with yesterday's positive, aggressive counter-attacking display with the bat they have reiterated their brittle flaws today with the ball.\n\nHowever, as with any rebuilding process, it is often a case of two steps forward and one step back. Today can be seen as a steep learning curve, against a side demonstrating many of the qualities to which England aspire: ruthlessness, discipline, calmness and composure.\n\nTomorrow is a chance to go again and emulate their opponents. Hope springs eternal.\n\nWe'll be back at 10:30 BST on Saturday."}
