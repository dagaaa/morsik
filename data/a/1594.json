It is harsh to place defeat solely at Vorm's door but he certainly could have done better with Herrera's winner.\n\nHarry Kane could not find his usual sure touch and Son Heung-min, superb this season, had one of those days when nothing went right.\n\nThe wait goes on without a trophy for both Spurs and Pochettino, who has now had four full seasons at the club.\n\nIt is something they must change soon to shed the tag of the team that always falters with the finishing line in sight.\n\nAlexis Sanchez has struggled to make a serious impact since his January switch from Arsenal to Manchester United - but the Chilean showed perfect timing to demonstrate his class on the Wembley stage he loves.\n\nWhen he showed great strength and athleticism to direct Pogba's cross back across Vorm for that vital equaliser, it was Sanchez's eighth goal for club and country at Wembley in eight appearances.\n\nSanchez is also still on course for a third FA Cup win, having won the trophy twice previously at Arsenal, scoring in victorious finals against Aston Villa and Chelsea.\n\nHere, this was Sanchez at his best - busy, dangerous, revelling in the fight and making the crucial contribution that has become his Wembley trademark.\n\nEyebrows were raised when Mourinho ignored the pace of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford in his starting line-up - but he was rewarded with the industry of Jesse Lingard, Romelu Lukaku and Sanchez - with the latter delivering a man-of-the-match performance.\n\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport:\"We deserve it. If we split the match into periods we were the best team for many of these periods. Even when they had the ball when we were winning we were totally in control.\n\n\"We lost control after the 1-0. At half-time we spoke - we came back late for the second half because we spoke a lot - and organised ourselves.\n\n\"We should ask ourselves why there are too many critics on all of us? We can finish second [in the Premier League] by getting six points. To do that with all the fantastic teams we play against will be an achievement for a club that couldn't do it for a few years now.\n\n\"And it will be a fourth final in three years. So, maybe too much criticism.\"\n\nTottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino, speaking to BBC Sport:\"I think every defeat is bad. It's difficult to accept but of course we are disappointed we are out and cannot achieve the final.\n\n\"We competed but not enough to win. We dominated the first half and were much better than Manchester United.\n\n\"United defended very well and so deep. We are disappointed because we are so close. We need to think, move on, finish the season and try to finish in the top four.\n\n\"I think we need to understand where we have come from. It's easy to talk about winning trophies.\n\n\"To win a trophy when you face a side like Manchester United, Chelsea or Manchester City is not easy. But the most important thing is we are able to compete.\""}
