The slight decrease was due mainly to a near 14% drop in the amount spent on hosting and processing migrants and refugees in rich countries, which cost a total of $14.2bn in 2017, the Paris-based think tank said.\n\nODA excluding refugee costs rose about 1%. Bilateral aid to the world's poorest countries climbed 4% to $26bn after years of decline, while humanitarian aid rose by 6.1% to $15.5bn.\n\nOnly five of the 29 members of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee - Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and Britain - met the United Nations' target of spending 0.7% of national income on development aid."}
