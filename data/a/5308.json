There needs to be investment in a range of new technologies that might provide the edge on a future battlefield.\n\nBut it is not simply a matter of spending more money. He pointed to the difficulty of passing budgets on Capitol Hill over successive years which, he said, had done more damage to US military readiness than any enemy in the field.\n\nThis is the first time the defence policies of the Trump administration have been spelled out in one place.\n\nThe threats listed are the same as under the Obama administration but the order of priority is different.\n\nFormerly, jihadist militant groups like Islamic State or al-Qaeda were the focus but latterly America's former Cold War opponents, Russia and China, have reasserted themselves strategically.\n\n\"We face growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia, nations that seek to create a world consistent with their authoritarian models,\" Mr Mattis said.\n\nA summary of the new strategy was published on the defence department's website.\n\nThe three great nuclear powers have posed a permanent existential threat to each other since Cold War days.\n\nIn recent years, however, fears have risen of the once-unthinkable: a direct conventional clash, particularly between Russia and the US in Syria or Ukraine.\n\nThe new strategy recognises that \"China and Russia in particular have been assiduously working over a number of years to develop their military capabilities to challenge our military advantages\", said Elbridge Colby, US deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development.\n\n\"This strategy really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to the basics of the potential for war and this strategy says the focus will be on prioritising preparedness for war, in particular major power war,\" he added.\n\nThe national defence strategy provides guidance for the 2019 defence budget.\n\nWhile the US was \"still strong\", the defence secretary said, its competitive edge had \"eroded in every domain of warfare - air, land, sea, space and cyberspace - and is continually eroding\".\n\nAppealing to Congress, he said: \"No strategy can survive without predictable funding. As hard as the last 16 years [that is, since the 9/11 attacks] have been, no enemy has harmed the US military more than defence spending caps and sequestration.\"\n\nReferring to the current wrangle in the Senate over a bill to fund federal agencies temporarily, he said a shutdown would have an impact on military operations.\n\n\"Our maintenance activities will probably pretty much shut down...over 50%, altogether of my civilian workforce will be furloughed...\" he said.\n\n\"We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, those obviously would stop.\""}
