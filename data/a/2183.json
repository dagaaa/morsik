Cesc Fabregas, who had seen an ambitious overhead kick well saved by Lloris, found Costa, whose shot was directed across the face of goal until it took a deflection off Walker to beat Lloris inside his near post.\n\nThis was effectively the end of the contest, with barely a blow traded between the sides before Chelsea captain Terry lifted the trophy."}
